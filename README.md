# Google-search
Search google from the Linux CLI through the python webbrowser module<br />
The following steps will install the module in your linux machine<br />
```
sudo mv search_google /usr/bin
mv .search.py ~
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/search_google
```
Now typing in search_google followed by the search term should open a google search for that term!
